# Columnar Maven project template

This directory contains an example Maven project you can use to get started with the Couchbase Columnar Java SDK.

It contains a Maven `pom.xml` configured with the required dependencies.

There's also a Checkstyle rule that prevents importing classes that are not part of the SDK's public API.
