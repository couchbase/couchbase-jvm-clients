/** A representation of a JSON object.
  *
  * Use the companion class to construct one.
  *
  * There are plenty of JSON libraries for Scala already.  So why make another one?
  *
  * The Couchbase Scala SDK does provide support for several popular JSON libraries already, but during benchmarking
  * it became clear that there were big performance differences between these and the simple `JsonObject` JSON API
  * provided with the Java SDK.
  *
  * There was also some questions about ease-of-use, with most of the Scala JSON libraries leaning towards
  * immutability.  Mutating deeply nested immutable data, such as JSON, requires advanced functional concepts such as
  * optics and zippers, and these aren't always easy to read or use.
  *
  * So the mini JSON library made up of `JsonObject` here and [[JsonArray]] are intended to fill a perceived niche by
  * providing two main advantages over the majority of Scala JSON libraries: speed and ease-of-use.
  *
  * 1. Speed.  This library is focused 100% purely on performance, and benchmarking indicates it's at least
  * three times faster to create a `JsonObject` with a few fields than to perform the equivalent operation in the
  * next-fastest Scala JSON library.
  *
  * 2. Ease-of-use.  The objects are mutable, which may raise an eyebrow for functional Scala programmers but does
  * allow a very simple API with no zippers, lenses, prisms or optics.
  *
  * And to stress, if you would prefer to use a functional and immutable JSON interface, then please look at some of the
  * those others supported by the Scala SDK, including the popular [[https://circe.github.io/circe/ Circe]].  Using
  * `JsonObject` is 100% optional and the Scala SDK makes every effort to not tie you into any one JSON library.
  *
  * In general the Couchbase Scala SDK returns Try` rather than throwing exceptions.  This interface is one of the
  * rare exceptions to this rule, and many methods will throw exceptions, for instance if a field is requested that
  * does
  * not exist.  If you would rather use a more functional interface then please see [[JsonObjectSafe]] and
  * [[JsonArraySafe]], which provide a 'safe' wrapper that performs all operations with Scala `Try`s.
  *
  * @define SupportedType     only certain types are allowed to be put into this.  They are: [[JsonObject]] and
  * [[JsonObjectSafe]], [[JsonArray]] and [[JsonArraySafe]], Int, Double, Short, Long, Float and null,
  * Boolean.
  * @define SupportedNumTypes the supported number types (Int, Double, Float, Long, Short)
  * @define Name              the field's key
  * @define NotExist          if the field does not exist
